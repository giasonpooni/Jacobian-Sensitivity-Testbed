# Jacobian and Sensitivity Propagation Testbed

A computational testbed for propagating local perturbations through
composed scientific models, with derivative verification,
coordinate-consistency tests, and explicit numerical limitations.

Short name **JSPT**. The reusable library import is `sensitivity`.

The project answers more than "what is the Jacobian of this function?"
Its central question is:

> How do changes in inputs and parameters propagate through this
> model—and does that answer remain consistent when we compose or
> re-express the model?

## Map

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  X["x"] --> F["f"]
  F --> Y["y"]
  X --> J["J = Df"]
  J --> DY["dy ~ J dx"]
  T["chart T, S"] --> JP["J' = S J T^{-1}"]
  J --> JP
  JP --> Phys["J' dx' = S J dx"]
  Cond{"kappa2(T) too large?"} -->|yes| Refuse["refuse · no clip"]
  T --> Cond
```

Caption: raw entries of J are not invariants. Physical pushforward is.
Coordinate comparisons require a declared invertible chart.

## What is in the first release

| Responsibility | What the testbed demonstrates |
| --- | --- |
| Derivative checking | Compare a declared Jacobian with central, forward, or complex-step estimates. |
| Composition | Verify that stepwise chain-rule propagation agrees with differentiating the composed map. |
| Coordinate consistency | Transform the model and the perturbation together, then compare physical predictions. |
| Local-validity testing | Measure where `dy ~ J dx` stops describing `f(x+dx)-f(x)`. |
| Correlated uncertainty | Reuse the same Jacobian in `Sigma_y ~ J Sigma_x J^T` and compare with Monte Carlo. |

The coordinate test is the structural distinction. For invertible linear
maps `x' = T x` and `y' = S y`,

```text
J' = S J T^{-1}.
```

We do **not** expect raw Jacobian entries or unscaled singular values to
be invariant under a change of units. We do expect

```text
J' dx' = S (J dx)
```

after the perturbation has been translated. Sensitivity scores that use
matrix norms must declare a scaling.

## Install and run

Python 3.12 or 3.13 and NumPy are required. [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
is the supported runner; a plain virtual environment also works.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/giasonpooni/Jacobian-Sensitivity-Propagation-Testbed.git
cd Jacobian-Sensitivity-Propagation-Testbed
uv run --python 3.13 python examples/quickstart.py
uv run --python 3.13 --with pytest pytest -q
```

Without uv:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e . pytest
PYTHONPATH=src python examples/quickstart.py
PYTHONPATH=src pytest -q
```

The quickstart writes `results/quickstart.md`.

## Using the library

The `sensitivity` package accepts declared models and arrays. Applications can
use `jacobian_at`, `first_order_covariance`, and `push_covariance` without
adopting the experiment suite or changing their domain types.

See [docs/KERNEL.md](docs/KERNEL.md) for the API and numerical constraints.

### Workbench covariance operation

The JSON endpoint `sensitivity.ciw_adapter` exposes
`jspt.covariance-propagate.v1` as an **operation provider**. It accepts a
content-addressed `covariance-artifact.v1` plus an explicit, ordered Jacobian
and returns the full propagated covariance with source, basis, unit, frame,
and linearization-point declarations. Weighted aggregation retains all
cross-covariances; invertible coordinate changes retain the existing chart
condition and round-trip checks.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m sensitivity.ciw_adapter < examples/covariance_request.json
```

The included shared-offset example returns mean variance `1.03`: the shared
variance `1` remains, while independent reading variance `0.09` is divided
among three readings. Negative weights can legitimately cancel a shared
component. The endpoint uses the existing covariance kernels; it neither
computes a derivative from the supplied matrix nor performs a nonlinear
Monte Carlo comparison. CIW may bind a specific clean Git revision as a
pinned subprocess; JSPT retains scientific ownership.

See [docs/CIW_ADAPTER.md](docs/CIW_ADAPTER.md) for the exact transport,
artifact contract, refusal meanings, and validation evidence.

```

Existing fluid, construction, and observer projects can consume
`sensitivity` where that removes duplication. They do not need the
experiment suite.

## Scope and limits

First-order, local, explicit compositions only. Global sensitivity,
discontinuous mode changes, and trajectory sensitivities are unsupported.

First-order covariance is exact for affine maps. For nonlinear maps the
testbed reports the Monte Carlo gap instead of treating the formula as
unconditionally adequate.
